## Learnings from Module 1 (Lec 1)
- This Jupyter notebook demonstrates how to use LangSmith's @traceable decorator for tracing and monitoring AI applications. It shows how to instrument RAG pipeline functions for automatic tracing and how to add metadata to runs for better organization and filtering in LangSmith. The notebook includes practical examples of tracing document retrieval, response generation, and OpenAI API calls.
- (What I implemented) The examples demonstrate how to progressively instrument Python functions with LangSmith's @traceable decorator, starting from basic function tracing and advancing to adding static metadata, runtime metadata, and finally chaining multiple traced functions to monitor complete workflows for comprehensive observability
